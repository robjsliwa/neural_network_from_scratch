# Neural network from scratch

These are my notes and simple projects to implement neural networks from scratch.

# Perceptron

Description on how to implement Perceptron is [here](Perceptron.md)

Implementation of Perceptron network is in nns/perceptron.py.

You can test the network on samples that teach it how to recognize logical AND and OR.  Or you can also see how it fails to learn XOR.  To run examples:

- poetry shell
- poetry install
- poetry run perceptron_and
- poetry run perceptron_or
- poetry run perceptron_xor
